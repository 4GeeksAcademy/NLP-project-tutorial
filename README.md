- Spam Detector is used to detect unwanted, malicious and virus infected texts and helps to separate them from the nonspam texts. It uses a binary type of classification containing the labels such as ‚Äòham‚Äô (nonspam) and spam.

-In our last exploring NLP notebook we built a spam detector using Natural Language Processing techniques and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification.

- In this project, we will have a brief and simple introduction to sentiment analysis using our Spam Detector dataset. 

## üå±  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read this instructions:
